MultiHoTT-Module
================
MultiHoTT-Module is a telemetry module basend on the Arduino ProMini plattform and is compatible to Graupner's HoTT, as well as Mutlplex's M-Link system.
It can be used as a stand-alone telemtry module or as an extension module for the Multirotor flight-control system MultiWii, where the telemtry data are gathered via MultiWii's serial protocol, named MSP.

Current status of development
=============================
* Evaluation of M-Link protocol
* Evaluation of HoTT protocol
* Read-out single cell voltage with 3S-4S support
* Talk with MutliWii over serial protocol
